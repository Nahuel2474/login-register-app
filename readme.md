## About the Project

This project is an eCommerce web application that allows users to browse and purchase products online. It consists of a frontend client built with React and a backend server implemented with Express and Node.js. The database is managed using MySQL, and the entire project is developed using TypeScript for improved type safety.

The client application uses React with TypeScript and incorporates schema-based form validation using Joi for error handling. The application state is managed with Zustand for a more straightforward state management solution, and React Router is used for efficient routing within the app.

On the backend, the project follows Clean Architecture principles, creating a well-organized folder structure. It includes an authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user registration and login functionality. Sequelize is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the MySQL database, facilitating smooth database operations.
